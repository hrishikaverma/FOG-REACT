# Fog Project

## Project Overview
The Fog Project is a web application developed using React for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end. The project aims to deliver a seamless, responsive user experience with modern technologies, leveraging the power of React.js for building a dynamic and interactive user interface, and Node.js to handle server-side operations efficiently.

The project is designed to meet real-world requirements and facilitate an easy-to-use platform for its users. The core functionality includes seamless integration between the front-end and back-end, providing a smooth, interactive experience.

## Tech Stack
- Front-end: React.js
- Back-end: Node.js
- Other Libraries: Express, CORS, etc.

## Features
- **User Interface (UI):** The application provides an intuitive and responsive interface built with React.js.
- **Dynamic Content:** Reactâ€™s component-based architecture ensures a highly dynamic and maintainable structure.
- **Server-Side Handling:** Node.js serves as the back-end, handling requests and responses efficiently.
- **Data Management:** The application can interact with the database (if used) to store, retrieve, and manage data in real time.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is fully responsive, adapting to all screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across different devices.
- **Security:** Basic security features implemented using Express and middleware.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Git (if you're cloning the repository)

### Steps to Run the Application
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Install Backend Dependencies
Navigate to the back-end folder (typically where your Node.js project is) and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
npm install
Install Frontend Dependencies
Navigate to the front-end folder (React project) and run the following command to install the required dependencies:

bash
npm install
Run the Application

Start the back-end server:
bash
npm start
Start the front-end server:
bash
npm start
This will run the application locally, and you can access the front-end through http://localhost:3000 (by default) and back-end at http://localhost:5000 (if configured this way).
